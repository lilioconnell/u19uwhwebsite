				<h1 id="1"></b> Brief </b></h1>
				<p> My aim is to design a website for the U19 NZ Girls UWH squad members, coaches, and
				supporters. I hope to create a common place to find information about camps, training and more
				which is accessible and useful for a range of consumers. Below are some basic aims of this project
				which will help me achieve checkpoints to build this in a structured process.

				<ul>
				<li> Create a basic plan with layout designs, colour pallet and features of the website</li>
				<li> Research the kinds of people who will be interested in this product to cater to a certain
				demographic </li>
				<li> Look at websites that have had similar function in the past to find inspiration and see what did/did not
				do well </li>
			</ul></p>

			<h2 id="3"><b> Relevant Implications: Describe </b></h2>
			<p> <b>Aesthetics</b>
				<br>
				Does the program look attractive to its users? If a website or digital media does not look appealing to a user
				they are unlikely to continue to use it and thus the website will be less successful. Does the colour pallet
				and design match with the purpose of the website? Do the aesthetics of the website reflect its purpose?
				<br><br>
				<b>Sustainability/Future Proofing:</b>
				<br>
				Is the program easy to add new features to? Maintaining and adding to the program should be easy if the program has been well made. 
				Making a change should not require major reconfiguration of the code. This means that a program should be designed to avoid repeating 
				information. If the program is designed so that code is repeated, it makes it much harder and more prone to errors, to try and change 
				or alter any of the information if needed.
				<br><br>
				<b>Usability:</b>
				<br>
				Is the program easy to understand? Is the output of the program easy to understand for the user? The program should use regular 
				english and 'speak the user's language', not "tech" language to make sure that the user can easily understand the information they 
				are being presented. The commands and requests for input should be intiutive and not likely to cause confusion for the user.

<h2><b> Sprint review: Where to next? </b></h2>
<br>
<p> This was the initial design, and it helped me to get a good idea of the kinds of colours, fonts and styles that I would like to focus on for this website.
	By using Bootstrap 5, I was able to do this quite easily and use the built-in features to help with resizing and working on how the elements would adjust to different
	devices. To save time, I was able to use the root style to set colour variables and make these automatic. Although everything was working as expected, I want to
	improve on the colour design of the website to make it consistent with the theme (maybe a sort of ocean colour scheme) as well as improving my coloumn designs.

		there was a blog_id as well and where to import this from. This meant that

<h2><b> Overall Reflection </b></h2>
<div class="col-container">
	<div class="col">
		<p> <b> What I would do differently: </b><br>If I were to do a project like this again, I think it would’ve been a great idea to make a much more detailed plan beforehand. This would mean I could know
			exactly what I was intending to do each day and make specific goals and checkpoints to make the process seem less strenuous.  I think each sprint could use a more specific backlog that is to be altered
			as the sprint proceeds. I also could have benefited from better time managment skills and prioritising the most crucial elements of the code since I often decided to begin working without really
			knowing what needed to be done and forgetting certain things that created errors in the long run. </p>
	</div>
	<div class="col">
		<p> <b> What I learnt: </b><br>

Overall, I learnt a lot about how complex databases connect and how this must be done to make sure everything is successfull and errors are prevented. Firstly, commiting regularly to github is very important to
			make sure that no progress is lost in the databases, as throughout this project I began using a new computer, and some of the files that had been on my previous computer did not transfer and if not
			for my git hub commits would have been lost completely. I also learnt the importance of not writing overly complicated code, so that when errors do inevitably occur, they can be much more easily identified
			and solved as opposed to looking for an unnecessarily long amount of time through the code for what has gone wrong.  Overall, my knowledge about code and the processes involved in a successful
			program development has been expanded a lot and I feel much more confident in my abilities.  </p>

	</div>

<h2><b> Revelant Implications: Address </b></h2>

<p> <b>Privacy:</b><br>
		This database cannot be accessed on http://127.0.0.1:5000/data (gives a page not found error). I have made sure that I haven’t requested any potentially dangerous or overly
	personal information from the users, only their name and email. By not asking for the phone number, any bank details or other personal information, this ensures that the
	users can stay safe were the database to be invaded by anyone with malicious intent. In the future it would be good to have the passwords hashed within the database as well,
	but this was outside my current capabilties.
	<br><br>
	<b>Functionality:</b>
	<br>
	To make sure that the database and website work properly and efficiently, I tested the code regularly and ran test quieries in a seperate file before inputting them into my server
	to make sure no problems were occuring. This was very useful as several errors did occur and I could solve these much more easily with a reduced amount of code in the test file as
	opposed to hunting through the server where the problem could have occured in several different places. I also made sure to have certain restraints of the data that could be put
	into the database, such as unique contraints on the user email. This means that each email only occurs once in the database and if it needs to be used in other parts of the database,
	there is no confusion around which file is the required file. The sql installer file also helped me to simply create the database and feel ok about making changes when they needed to
	be made, as I could easiy delete and remake the database during the development process.
	<br><br>
	<b>	Usability:</b>
	<br>
	I have made sure that the program 'speaks the users language'. I did this by making sure all my request messages were clear, so the user knew exactly what they were expected to do. I also
	tried to make my error messages and requests human-like, by making them slightly less formal. This means that the user can understand much more clearly what is expected of them. I also asked
	several friends and family members to try using my program and critique me on what they found difficult or confusing. This means I now know that the interface of my program will be understood
	by a range of people and not just make sense to myself and those in the coding world.
	</p>
	<br>
	<b>Future Proofing:</b>
	<br>
	I have made sure that the functions are appropriately named and well organised. This means that if I were to come back to the program at a later date to add any new code or make
	adjustments, the code will be easy to understand and alter. I also thoroughly doctyped and commented my code, so that I know what purpose each function serves and what each argument represents.
	I also tried to compress any process that was repeatedly used into a function, so that it could be called when needed. By doing this, I prevented having to write almost identical code several
	times, meaning there is much less clutter within functions. This also means that if changes need to be made for a certain process or command, a change only needs to be made once, instead of
	several times throughout the code.
