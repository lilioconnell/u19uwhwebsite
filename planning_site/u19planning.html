				<h1 id="1"></b> Brief </b></h1>
				<p> My aim is to design a website for the U19 NZ Girls UWH squad members, coaches, and
				supporters. I hope to create a common place to find information about camps, training and more
				which is accessible and useful for a range of consumers. Below are some basic aims of this project
				which will help me achieve checkpoints to build this in a structured process.

				<ul>
				<li> Create a basic plan with layout designs, colour pallet and features of the website</li>
				<li> Research the kinds of people who will be interested in this product to cater to a certain
				demographic </li>
				<li> Look at websites that have had similar function in the past to find inspiration and see what did/did not
				do well </li>

			<h2 id="3"><b> Relevant Implications: Describe </b></h2>
			<p> <b>Aesthetics</b>
				<br>
				Does the program look attractive to its users? If a website or digital media does not look appealing to a user
				they are unlikely to continue to use it and thus the website will be less successful. Does the colour pallet
				and design match with the purpose of the website? Do the aesthetics of the website reflect its purpose?
				<br><br>
				<b>Sustainability/Future Proofing:</b>
				<br>
				Is the program easy to add new features to? Maintaining and adding to the program should be easy if the program has been well made. 
				Making a change should not require major reconfiguration of the code. This means that a program should be designed to avoid repeating 
				information. If the program is designed so that code is repeated, it makes it much harder and more prone to errors, to try and change 
				or alter any of the information if needed.
				<br><br>
				<b>Usability:</b>
				<br>
				Is the program easy to understand? Is the output of the program easy to understand for the user? The program should use regular 
				english and 'speak the user's language', not "tech" language to make sure that the user can easily understand the information they 
				are being presented. The commands and requests for input should be intiutive and not likely to cause confusion for the user.

<p> In this sprint, I am developing a main menu for my program, where the user can choose between two options: To review the pasta 
	menu or to quit the program completely. This will run in a loop, and I will be creating a function to print the menu when requested 
	with the name of the item and its price. </p>

<h2><b> Sprint review: Where to next? </b></h2>
<br>
<p> In this sprint I designed an simple base program to print the menu for my pasta bar when requested from 
	the user, as well as the prices of the pastas. I achieved this firstly by creating a number of basic functions 
	such as 'get_integer' and 'get_string' which are basic ways to request user input with basic validation and 
	can be called anytime an input is needed. Currently the validation is very fundamental, but will become more 
	advanced as the program evolves. The user additionally has the option to quit the program if they wish. 
	This is because the program runs in a loop that requests the user's menu choice until they click "Q" to quit, 
	which terminates the loop. A short confirmation message thanking the user is then printed. To prevent a typical 
	error, I have added a statement to my code, which converts the menu choice of the user to uppercase. This means 
	that no matter whether the user uses a lowercase or uppercase, the input will be valid and not cause errors. One 
	thing that I noted I need to address later, is that my pastas and their prices are written as one entity in the list. 
	This means that right now I wouldn't be capable of adding together the prices of the pastas as they are not integers. 
	I will address this error in more complex versions of this program.

			During this sprint, I ran into a several problems and errors. The first, was when the user selected an index 
			that was out of the suitable range, the porgram continued to execute, and would not inform the user of the error 
			until they were nearly finished with the order. *View screenshot*. To resolve this, I had to create a function 
			that could assign a limit on the input of the user, so that they were told there had been an error and could try 
			once more. I achieved this by creating a 'get_integer_limits' function where I can assign a lower and upper boundary 
			on the user input each time the function is called.

			Another problem I struggled with, was the length of sublists for printing. In the main 'print_list' 
			function I created, I made it so that if the sublist did not contain not two entities, there was an error. 
			This was effective when printing certain lists, like the main menu, but presented a problem when trying to 
			print lists with three or more entities, as it would simply cause an error if called. To resolve this, I made
			a print function specifically for the review order list. This is so the two entity function can still be used,
			as it is frequently, but won't cause errors when I attempt to review the user order. One thing that I observed, 
			is when the user is ordering, they are able to select a pasta they have already ordered and order more of them. 
			This is satisfactory, but when reviewing the order, they are printed out separately although they are the same pasta. 
			*View screenshot* In the upcoming sprints, I am going to advance this, so the program can recognize that these values
			are the same, and thus group them together. I moreover would like to do work on the validation that my program uses, 
			as well creating functions for removing pizzas from the order and calculating the ultimate price of the users order.

<h4><b> The biggest challenge of Sprint 6 </b></h4>
<br>
<p> 
	In this sprint, I struggled a lot with getting the program to complete the order correctly. I ran through several tests (shown below), and 
	attempted methods to have the program correctly confirm and then clear the order if that was the users choice. I initially decided I 
	wanted to develop quite a large function with lots of code to confirm the order. The user would initially see what they had ordered and was 
	subsequently asked for their choice of pick-up or delivery and then asked for their details and a confirmation. This was quite clunky and caused 
	some chaotic code and weird loop errors. When the user confirms all details, they would still be sent back to the main menu and it had 
	not been reset. What I have now decided to do is have separate functions for review order, enter details and complete order placement as well
	as other small function for things like 'get_delivery_details' and 'get_pickup_details'. This means none of the code gets jumbled up 
	because of it all being in one place was doing and everything is much tidier having several smaller functions. After the user chooses to 
	confirm their whole order the program prints their final receipt and clears the lists. 
</p>

<div class="col-container">
	<div class="col">
		<p> 
			The first way I expected to achieve this was through a counter. I made an empty list called terminate, which was appended when the user 
			chose to quit the program. This was problematic as I was putting functions inside functions, which is never a good idea. The theory was, 
			that when this list was appended, the program would recognize that 'terminate' was not equal to zero and end the loop.

			Shortly after drafting the code shown, I realised the error in my ways. I realised I did not want the whole program to quit and rather 
			just required the order and user details to be cleared, so a new order could be placed. I decided I would do this by having the user choose 
			to confirm their order, and then use .clear() to empty the lists since this order was now completed. This was much more useful than the 
			previous attempt, as I did not need to involve a whole new list and append values. The code was much more succinct and less prone to 
			errors in the future.

			In this sprint I additionally used a python style checker to make sure my code was not violating any major python conventions and that there 
			was nothing likely to cause errors in my future. As you can see, it didn't go so well. It turns out I had many errors in my code, by fortunately 
			many of these were the same. The recurring one seemed to be that my code lines were overly long. I am going to go through during my next sprint 
			and shorten many of these lines as it improves readability and removes clutter. The other errors indicated in this test were to do with formatting
			(too many/too few linebreaks) and were easily fixed. The last error reported was I had been writing 'while run == True', and this is typically

			Previously, I had only had an 'except' statement, without any further clarification. This was a useful error to be notified of, as it may prevent my

			I am unsure of how I did never noticed this in previous sprints, but when running some basic tests, I realised the program was still printing 
			that the user had ordered zero of a pasta. This is suitable when the customer is simply in the order pasta function, as it cleary shows that they 
			did not order any. The problem was that when the user reviews or confirms their order, it would still show the value as zero. I think this would 
			be considerably better if it showed the user that they had ordered none, but then removed it from the list. This also causes an infinite loop if 
			the user attempts to remove a pasta from their order as no number is within the appropriate range. I could not allow the user to enter zero 
			pastas, but this would place them in a loop until they ordered some.

			 removed all the pasta from their order, it printed an empty message saying "In your basket you now have:", followed by nothing. I did not like the way this was formatted and wished to change it.

			I tried a few ways to solve this. The first was to alter the code to print the basket no matter what was in it, but this led to formatting issues and printing double reviews. This was not acceptable, 
			and did not reach the standard I wanted for my program, so I had to try another way. By writing the code in this way, the problem was mostly solved. The only remaining issue was that an order with 
			remaining pastas would be printed twice, as it was recognizing that the amount was not zero, as well as the length of the order list not being zero.

		<p> I solved this by altering the code involved in printing out the updated user order after removing or reducing a pasta. I made the if statements much more clear and made sure there was no overlap in them

			I put my code through the same style checker once again as I knew there were still several errors that I had chosen to resolve at a later date. Firstly, I used the style checker
			that is built into the PyCharm Software, which was also useful for catching spelling mistakes within my code. After this, I entered the code into an online style checker and received
			only this message *view screenshot*. At this point, I began some research into alternative ways to shorten my lines of code, as the main style error I was informed about by a style 
			checker was that my code lines were excessively long. I went through my code and shortened several of the function names to two words or less.

		<p> <b> What I would do differently: </b><br> If I were to develop a new program like this, I think it would be beneficial to make a much more thorough plan of the program beforehand.

		<p> <b> What I learnt: </b><br> Overall, I have learnt a lot about error prevention and many techniques to aid with this. Firstly, I think it is very helpful to check your code really 
		thoroughly every once in a while to find any errors or coding mistakes you may have missed. I also learnt how important it is to try to separate almost every action into its own function.
		This means that if an error occurs within that function, I can make a change once and it will be immediately solved everywhere it was called. I also learnt a lot about doctyping and how useful
		this is in making you code clear and easy to understand. Overall, my knowledge about code and the processes involved in a successful program development has been expanded a lot and I feel much more 
		confident in my abilities.  </p>

<h2><b> Revelant Implications: Address </b></h2>
<p> <b>What have I done to make sure that my program respects user privacy?:</b>
	<br>
	I have designed my program to clear all the information input by the user when the order is complete. This means that their order and customer details are deleted and can not be retrieved. 
	In a more advanced program, the program may store the user information for later orders, but I have decided against this in mine. I tested this by adding in code that prints the user details, 
	and running this once the order had been complete. The results were that the list containing customer details was now empty, which was the correct protocol. This means that after an order is 
	completed, no third parties or other user can access the information of past users, keeping them safe from any predators.
	<br><br>
	<b>What have I done to make future proofing easier?:</b>
	<br>
	I have made sure that the functions are appropriately named and well organised. This means that if I were to come back to the progra,, at a later date to add any new code or make adjustments, 
	the code will be easy to understand and alter. I also thoroughly doctyped and commented my code, so that I know what purpose each function serves and what each argument represents. I also 
	tried to compress any process that was repeatedly used into a function, so that it could be called when needed. By doing this, I prevented having to write almost identical code several times, 
	meaning there is much less clutter within functions. This also means that if changes need to be made for a certain process or command, a change only needs to be made once, instead of several 
	times throughout the code. 
	<br><br>
	<b>What have I done to make my program user friendly (usability)?:</b>
	<br>
	I have made sure that the program 'speaks the users language'. I did this by making sure all my request messages were clear, so the user knew exactly what they were expected to do. I also tried 
	to make my error messages and requests human-like, by making them slightly less formal. This means that the user can understand much more clearly what is expected of them. I also asked several 
	friends and family members to try using my program and critique me on what they found difficult or confusing. As can be seen in many of the changes made in Sprint Six and Sprint Seven, they had 
	quite a lot of feedback. This means I now know that the interface of my program will be understood by a range of people and not just make sense to myself and those in the coding world.
