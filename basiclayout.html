            Welcome to the website for New Zealand’s U19 Girl’s Underwater Hockey Trials and Team! We are currently in the process of trialling
            and selecting two teams of young players to take to Trans Tasmans in the Gold Coast 2023 and are ultimately leading up to Age Ground
            World Championship in Turkey 2024.

        <h2> What is UWH? </h2>
        <p class="body-text">
            Underwater hockey is an internationally played sport that involves two teams competing to move a puck across the bottom of a swimming
            pool into the opposition’s goal using a small stick. It is a limited contact sport, and players must hold their breath while playing
            (no scuba tanks). New Zealand is a top performer in international underwater hockey, having taken countless wins out over the years and
            currently holding 5 out of 8 world titles.
